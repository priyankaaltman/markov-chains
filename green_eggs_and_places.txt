Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places!
You're off and away!

You have brains in your head.
You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself 
any direction you choose.
You're on your own. And you know what you know.
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.

Would you could you in a house?
Would you could you with a mouse?
Would you could you in a box?
Would you could you with a fox?
Would you like green eggs and ham?
Would you like them, Sam I am?
