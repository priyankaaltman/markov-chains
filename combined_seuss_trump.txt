Would you could you in a house?
Would you could you with a mouse?
Would you could you in a box?


Madam President, Mr. Secretary-General, world leaders, ambassadors, and distinguished delegates:

Would you could you with a fox?
Would you like green eggs and ham?
Would you like them, Sam I am?

One year ago, I stood before you for the first time in this grand hall. I addressed the threats facing our world, and I presented a vision to achieve a brighter future for all of humanity.
